# Resources

## View Resource List

Resources belong to an environment, and you can view the list of resources in the environment view.

1. Click on `Applications` in the left navigation bar.
2. By default, you will enter the view of the first environment. You can switch to view resources under different projects or environments through the top-level breadcrumb. You can also set the default environment to enter through the breadcrumb.
3. In the `Resources` tab, you can view the list of resources under this environment.

## View Resource Details

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Find the resource you need to view and click its name to enter the detail page.

## Create Resource

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Click `New Resource`.
3. Select the resource type. If you want to create from template, enable the `Use Template` option, then select the template and version. For more information about resource types, please refer to [Resource Definition](/operation/resource-definition).
4. Enter the `Name`, `Description`, and `Labels`. The name should be unique under the same environment.
5. Fill in the configuration form, configuration items depends on the template or resource type you selected.
6. Click the `Save and Deploy` button.

## Create Resource Draft

You can create a resource as draft.

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Click `New Resource`.
3. Select the resource type. If you want to create from template, enable the `Use Template` option, then select the template and version.
4. Enter the `Name`, `Description`, and `Labels`. The name should be unique under the same environment.
5. Fill in the configuration form, configuration items depends on the template or resource type you selected.
6. Click the downward arrow to the right of the `Save and Deploy` button.
7. Click `Save Draft`.

## Edit Resource

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Find the resource you need to edit, click `Edit`.
3. Modify the configuration as needed, then click the `Save and Deploy` button. The resource will be deployed once after editing.

## Resource Dependency

Resources can depend on each other by using output references. The referenced entity will be deployed before and deleted after the dependent entities.

For example, if a container service depends on a MySQL resource, the container service can reference the MySQL endpoint in its environment variable as `${res.my-db-name.address}`.
The output reference is in the following format: `${res.<Resource Name>.<Resource Output Name>}`.

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Find the resource you need to rollback.
3. Click on the operation drop-down button, select `Rollback`.

## Delete Resource

Delete resource will delete resource configuration in Walrus, and remove all components of the resource.

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Find the resource you need to delete.
3. Make sure no other resources depend on it. Click the `Delete` button.
4. In the pop-up window, you can choose whether to cleanup the components. If you uncheck `Clean up all components`, the components of the resource will be retained, but will no longer be managed by Walrus.
5. Click the `Confirm` button to complete the deletion.

## Start Resource

Start operation will start all components of the resource, used to restore stopped resources or deploy draft resources to the environment.

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Locate `Stopped` or `Undeployed` resource you need to start.
3. Click the `Start` button.

![resource-start](/img/v0.5.0/application/resource/resource-start.png)

## Stop Resource

Stop operation will stop all components of the resource, unlike delete operation, stop operation will not delete the resource configuration in Walrus.

1. Navigate to the `Resources` tab in the environment view.
2. Locate `Ready` resource you need to stop.

！[resource-stop](/img/v0.5.0/application/resource/resource-stop.png)

3. Click the `Stop` button，then click the `Confirm` button in the pop-up window to complete the stop operation.

> Caution: Whether a resource can be stopped depends on the resource's labels. If the resource's labels contain `walrus.seal.io/stoppable: "true"`, the resource can be stopped. By default, resources in development or staging environments will automatically add this label when created. You can actively declare this label when creating resources so that resources can be stopped in production environments.

## Components

Components are the entities generated by the resource deployment. In the resource list or detail page, you can view its components, including component name, type, status, create time, etc. You can operate components as needed, such as viewing logs, connecting to the terminal, etc.
